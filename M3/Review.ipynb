    "## Jupyter Notebook Code Cells\n",
    "Remember that Python runs one line at time. We have been restricting ourselves to using Jupyter Notebooks. In a notebook file (which as the extension `.ipynb`), you may have multiple types of cells including Markdown, Code, Raw NBCovert, and Heading. We have only been using Code and Markdown cells. This cell is a Markdown cell. You can see this two ways: (1) the dropdown on the toolbar or (2) the rendering of the cell into nicely formatted HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you add a new cell to a notebook file it is a Code cell. Code cells are where you type the python commands you want to execute. In some sense, each code cell acts in isolation. What that means is that you can run a code cell, then add a new code cell above it, and run that code cell referencing the variables in the cell below it (which was already run). While this is very, very convenient when trying out new concepts (or learning new concepts in class), it can be become problematic when try replicate the results later. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you shutdown the Jupyter Notebook server, the notebook you were working in keeps the output and line nubmers in square brackets. However, when you restart the Jupyter Notebook server, all of the variables, user-defined functions, etc. are no longer in working memory. This means you will not have access to those variables and have to re-run all of the Code cells.\n",
