Subject: Last Shipment to Bruce Riggs

Hi Rosco, 

I just got off the phone with Bruce Riggs about an overdue account and he said sis last shipment was 8 days late and there were broken seals. (This is invoice #G56-824 for $2000).

Binish â€“ I told him we would credit is account for $2,400. Can you make that happen ASAP?

Bruce is a good customer, who has sent us alot of business and I would like to keep him happy.

Mark
