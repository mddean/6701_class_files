Subject: Performance Evaluation Process

Hi,

As discussed at the last staff meeting, we are rolling out a new performance evaluation process. This is part of our ongoing effort to support staff development and promote fairness and transparency. 

Everyone will go through the process of self-evaluation and then discuss with their supervisor how well they met expectations around key objectives over the past year.  Everyone is required to complete the evaluation, even if you have been at FW for less than one year. Please complete your self-evaluation by next Friday at this link:

After you complete the self-evaluation, your supervisor will schedule a meeting directly with you.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me or to your supervisor.

Sincerely,
Chelsea
