Hi Leroy,

I hope you are well.

I just wanted to drop you a quick note to remind you that $675 for invoice #G56-900 is 46 days past due.

I would be really grateful if you could confirm that everything is on track for payment.

Kindly disregard this email if payment has already been processed.

Best regards, 
Mark
