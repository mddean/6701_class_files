Subject: Frisky Whisky Announces Release of Wicked Magnolia Gin

Just in time for summer, Frisky Whisky is proud to announce the release of Wicked Magnolia. The new spirit is made in small batches with the essence of locally harvested Southern Magnolia petals.

“We asked what does the modern gin drinker want and like?” says Master Distiller Max MacCallum. As a result, Frisky Whisky developed this versatile spirit that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. “Our tasting members went wild for this flavor.”

Crafting an exciting new formula for gin is done by hand-grinding magnolias and other botanicals in order to closely monitor the grind size of each ingredient. Distilled in a 40-gallon copper still, Wicked Magnolia provides a unique twist on the traditional spirit.

To celebrate the launch of this new spirit, the distiller has created three new cocktail recipes using local mixers. Available for purchase at the Virginia distillery, Wicked Magnolia Gin is part of the tasting experience. Open from 12pm – 6 pm on Saturday and Sunday, tours and tastings offer unique insight into the operations of Frisky Whisky.
