Hi, 

Thank you for reserving a spot for the Frisky Whisky tour this Saturday at 1 pm. You’ll get an entertaining and educational behind-the-scenes look at our production process, led by one of our talented and knowledgeable associates. At the end, we’ll have a tasting where you can sample some old favorites and new creations.

The tour of our production area typically last from 30 to 60 minutes. Parking is available across the street from the distillery.

We look forward to seeing you on Saturday.

Cheers, 
Julie Hobbs
Frisky Whisky Tasting Room Manager
