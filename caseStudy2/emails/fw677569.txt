Hi Bruce,

Good catching up with you today. 

Iâ€™m writing to confirm our conversation about invoices #G56-824 and #G56-798 in the total amount of $8,400. You will remit payment for $6,000 tomorrow. We will give you a credit for $2,400 for the late shipment and damaged goods.

Again, please accept my apologies for the poor logistics.

Many thanks for your continued business.

Best regards, 
Mark
